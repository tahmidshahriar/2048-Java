Most of my description is present in the comments section of my code. I created a 2048 clone with features such as a timer, power ups and high scores.
I imported ArrayList and Preferences in GameCourt in order to create them.

I created a basic 2048 first. I used the squares given at start and modified them to create grids and panels and etc. The movement keys were trickier
as the logic behind them had to be well thought out. I have a square class, which creates the display. As can be seen from the comments, the square 
class is used a total of 4 times to create four different squares.

I also have a game class. This was similar to the one provided. However, I added buttons to it as a feature which uses power ups to do different things 
(the things are also explained in the comments). There is also a button to help explain the features ("WHAT!"). 

Finally, I have a GameCourt class. This basically controls the whole game. I make all my changes here and update timers, high scores through GameCourt.java.
When called, it initializes the grid, and then the game begins!

As I was unsure as to what exactly the readme should hold, I have made sure to comment every part of my code to make sure everything is easy to understand.

The most basic part of my game is based on the game provided.
